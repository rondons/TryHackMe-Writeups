This is a place where I do my tryhackme writeups with a smidge of drama and storytelling added to the mixture. It's not for everyone, but I find its a good way to make people actually read the whole of the writeup, and its a good way for me to not get bored doing it. Cringy or not, I hope you have fun whenever you see my writeups.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub and happy hacking.
